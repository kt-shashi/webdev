        I still remember the first day I saw her. It was in English. She had positioned herself at the front of
        the classroom and I took the seat directly behind her. My friend Rebecca walked in a few moments
        later and noticing that there was no empty seat next to me, looked confused.
    </p>


    <p>
        Sitting behind Leilani had not been my choice. Natural desire had pushed me that way and it
        would have burned within me had a decided to sit anywhere else. It might have been the darkness
        of her skin, compared to the paleness of all of ours that pulled me in. Her lips were stained coral
        and she smelled like candy. I assumed she did not know perfume and make-up were not allowed.
        Her hair was a thick sheet of black and it hung over the back of her chair, taunting me. I wanted so
        badly to stroke it and that longing scared me.
    </p>

    <p>
        "<i><b>Excuse me</b></i>", she said, turning around. "<i><b>How much is the Shakespeare collection for this
                class?</i></b>"

    </p>

    <p>
        I…I donʼt know. Syllabi for all of our classes arrived in the mail in the summer. I gave mine to my
        mother and she purchased all of the books. Iʼm sure my mother didnʼt even know how much she
        paid for it. But Leilani made me wish I had cared.
    </p>


    <p>
        I watched Leilani as she eyed a copy of the collection that was on the desk of the girl beside her.
        Her eyes were distinct: almond like in shape and color. They had drifted away from me and I
        needed them back. Wanting to say something to her so badly, I blurted out, "<i><b>I think it was around
                $60.</i></b>"
    </p>


    <p>
        "<i><b>Oh, thanks</i></b>", she said. She didnʼt look at me again. Instead she scribbled something in her
        notebook: <i><b>"check library for Shakespeare collection"</i></b> I read over her shoulder.
    </p>

    <p>
        As time went on, Leilani became a prime conversation piece for everyone in St. Maryʼs. It was
        senior year and we were all more than ready to graduate and go to college where we would have
        boys in our classes. Coming to St. Maryʼs at this time seemed backwards and though Iʼm sure she
        had a reason, I never found it out what it was. They were simple questions: "<i><b>are you new in town?</i></b>"
        ,
        "<i><b>where did you live before?</i></b>" what made you come here? But I was too wrapped up in the social
        politics of St. Maryʼs to ask what I wanted to know.
    </p>

    <p>
        Instead of speaking to her, we stared as she floated from class to class alone, her uniform skirt like
        a tent over her wide hips. We commented on how poor she had to be considering her Reebok
        Classics. She didnʼt even wear pearls.
    </p>

    <p>
        There were a number of times I knew for sure Leilani had heard our comments about her oversized
        ass and ownership of a bus pass. A few times she had looked directly at me, almond eyes
        brimming with amusement as she continued walk
